## 📋 Executive Summary

Automated cleanup script removing 66 non-documentation files (18.1% reduction) from Python dependency manager docs, optimizing search indexing and reducing storage overhead.

## 🔍 Problem Analysis

Our weekly sync pulls entire `/docs` directories including substantial bloat:

| Manager | Before | After | Removed | Reduction % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conda** | 151 | 103 | 48 | 31.7% |
| **Pip** | 117 | 111 | 6 | 5.1% |
| **Poetry** | 18 | 17 | 1 | 5.5% |
| **UV** | 77 | 66 | 11 | 14.2% |
| **Total** | **363** | **297** | **66** | **18.1%** |

**Removed file types**: Build scripts, web assets, media files, development artifacts, config files

## ✅ Solution Design

**Strategy**: Keep only `.md`, `.rst`, and `_metadata.yml` files. Remove everything else.

**Key Features**:

- Cross-platform compatibility (bash/zsh/GitHub Actions)
- Dual-target operation (`temp-docs/` and `src/assets/`)
- Safe execution with explicit patterns and error handling
- Detailed reporting with color-coded output
- Smart cleanup preserving directory structure

## 🎯 Impact & Benefits

**File Reduction**: 363 → 297 files (18.1% reduction)

**Per-Manager Results**: 66 files removed (Conda: 48, UV: 11, Pip: 6, Poetry: 1) with Conda having the highest cleanup impact due to build artifacts and media files.

**Performance Gains**:

- Faster Tantivy indexing (18.1% fewer files)
- Reduced Docker image size
- Improved search relevance
- Faster CI/CD workflows

**Business Value**:

- 18.1% storage efficiency and cost reduction
- Better developer experience with focused search
- Automated maintenance reducing manual overhead
- Scalable strategy for future dependency managers

## 🔄 Implementation

**Workflow Integration**:

```yaml
# Placed after documentation copy, before git commit
- name: Clean non-documentation files
  run: ./scripts/clean-assets.sh
```

**Developer Usage**:

```shell
./scripts/clean-assets.sh  # Run from project root
```

## 🔮 Future Considerations

**Enhancements**: Selective media retention, manager-specific rules, metrics collection, validation checks

**Monitoring**: Track file trends, search performance, documentation completeness, optimization opportunities
